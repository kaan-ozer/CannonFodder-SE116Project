With my team for the SE116 course, we created a game played via Java in the terminal. The aim of the game is to reach the highest possible level by strategizing against increasingly challenging opponents as you progress. While doing this, you can take items from your enemies and add them to your inventory or equip them. Using the abilities unique to each character, you can experience a strategic mini-game experience far from monotony.
